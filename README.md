This repository has two purposes:

1. Hosting the an example job for CyberGIS-Compute which uses the [Pysal Access package](https://pysal.org/access/index.html) to calculate spatial accessibility to doctors in Chicago, Illinois, U.S. The [IntroToCyberGIS-Compute.ipynb notebook](IntroToCyberGIS-Compute.ipynb) walks through a bit of information on spatial accessibility and runs the pysal example model with CyberGIS-Compute. You can also run the analysis in the [ChicagoAccess.ipynb Jupyter notebook](ChicagoAccess.ipynb).
2. Hosting introductory materials for those who want to learn more about CyberGIS-Compute! The [IntroToCyberGIS-Compute.ipynb notebook](IntroToCyberGIS-Compute.ipynb) walks through the basics of CyberGIS-Compute: running models focused on spatial accessibility and exploring the anatomy of a CyberGIS-Compute job. Additionally, the [ContributingAModel.ipynb](ContributingAModel.ipynb) notebook provides a step-by-step guide for those hoping to contribute a CyberGIS-Compute job of their own.
